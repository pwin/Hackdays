###Black Slopes

Ok, so you're looking for more challenges.  In the Black Slopes you can go and hunt down your own data sets (use the wiki [Data Sources](https://github.com/pwin/Hackdays/wiki/Data%20Sources) page for some sources and ideas).  There are some exciting javascript libraries to work with.  You can find out more from the wiki [Javascript Libraries](https://github.com/pwin/Hackdays/wiki/Javascript%20Libraries) page.  

Here are some suggestions:
* Look at using a clustering approach to sorting RSS feeds or Scottish Government spreadsheets (using title and perhaps some metadata) - [http://code.google.com/p/figue/source/browse/trunk/figue.js](http://code.google.com/p/figue/source/browse/trunk/figue.js) as described in [http://code.google.com/p/figue/wiki/Introduction](http://code.google.com/p/figue/wiki/Introduction) has K-means and other clustering calculations.  Another possible approach is to use the [https://github.com/harthur/classifier](https://github.com/harthur/classifier) Naive Bayesian classifier and some appropriatly selected training scripts
* Explore the 3D visualisation library [three.js](http://threejs.org/)
* Javascript is being used to develop a [complete PDF viewer](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).  Check it out and see what you can do.
