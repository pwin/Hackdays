Hackdays
========

This is a collection of materials for hack days that work.  They are organised into groups and each folder holds material of roughly the same level of complexity.  The colour scheme used mirrors that of ski slopes in which green slopes are easy beginner territory from which one can advance through blue and red to reach the black slopes where the terrain is much more challenging.

You might find a specialised code editor helpful. [Here](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/22-neat-code-editors-for-windows/) are some examples.

All the exercises are designed to use only a web browser, javascript, and some data.  If you're new to Javascript check out [http://eloquentjavascript.net/](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) as a good introduction.
